## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- BEM
- Dark theme design
- Flexbox and GRID
- Mobile first design
- Accessibility focus design
- Responsive design
- free API
- Fetch, Async/await

### What I learned

Above all, I learned to work with the [phind AI](https://www.phind.com/), which was a great tool for me. It helped me a lot and always managed to direct me correctly, or even evaluate and complete my code. My work was suddenly much more efficient and faster. The key was only in learning how to ask a proper question. Next I practiced working with API and async / await funstions. For this I learned how to use try...catch statements.

### Continued development

**The most important thing is to treat and hide the API key in the future!** Also I would like to add some new features e.g. render the watchlist in the same order, or to make the "add" and "remove" buttons change so that the user can add and remove movies directly on the home page.
